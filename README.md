# Baldi's Extended Schoolhouse

It's Baldi's Basics, but with a simple twist: somehow, Baldi has raised enough money to expand the school! And of course, more space means more classroom, which means more noteboos for your friend to forget. Like usual, find all the notebooks to win!

Changes made from Baldi's Basics Classic 1.4.3:
- Two new maps to play
- Two gameplay style options
- Optional Background music
- Added a few changes introduced in BB+ and BBCR (new voice clips, baldicator, etc.)
- Two new item: the Speedy Sneakers, and the Attendance Slip!
- Changes to Baldi's AI
- more stuff im probably forgetting

## Downloading the Source Code
**Note**: If you just want to play the game, the download link is [here](https://github.com/Junimeek/BaldiExtended/releases/tag/beta-0.4.1). Just scroll down and click on `BaldiExtended_Windows_0.4.1` and it'll start downloading.

The stuff that follows is just for the nerds such as myself:<br/>
Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), and create a Unity account or log into your Unity account if you already have one. Next, install [Unity Engine 2021.3.13f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.13).

After that, you can clone this repository wherever you want. Then go back to Unity Hub, click the arrow directly next to the "Add" button, and hit "Add project from disk". Select the folder that contains all the files you just downloaded, click "Add project", and now you can open it in the Unity editor.
