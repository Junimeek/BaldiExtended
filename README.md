# Baldi's Extended Schoolhouse

It's Baldi's Basics, but with a simple twist: somehow, Baldi has raised enough money to expand the schoolhouse! And of course, more space means more classroom, which means more noteboos for your friend to forget. Like usual, find all the notebooks to win! It's THAT easy!

Major changes made from Baldi's Basics Classic version 1.4.3:
- Two new maps to play
- A Challenge mode (currently limited, but there's plans for a LOT more)
- Two gameplay style options
- Optional Background music
- Added a few changes introduced in BB+ and BBCR (new voice clips, baldicator, item swapping, etc.)
- Six new items: the Speedy Sneakers, the Attendance Slip, Diet BSODA, Crystal Flavored Zesty Bar, the Party Popper, and the Dangerous Hammer!
- Unlimited quarters with the brand new Wallet Slot!
- Minor changes to Baldi's AI
- more stuff i'm probably forgetting

I'll upload this to sites such as GameBanana at some point, but not until version 1.0 releases (i.e, whenever I stop doing major code rewrites and the only new content will be in the form of new maps and items).

## Downloading and using the Source Code
**Note**: If you just want to play the game, the download link is [here](https://github.com/Junimeek/BaldiExtended/releases/tag/beta-0.5.0a). Just scroll down and click on `BaldiExtended_Windows_0.5.0a` and it'll start downloading.

The stuff that follows is just for the nerds such as myself:<br/>
Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), and create a Unity account or log into your Unity account if you already have one. Next, install [Unity Engine 2021.3.45f2](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.45f2).

- **IMPORTANT NOTICE:** If you haven't updated Unity since October 2025, you need to update to a new version as a security vulnerability was discovered. You can read more about it [here](https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-platform-protection-take-immediate-action-to-protect-your-games-and-apps/1688031).

After that, you can clone this repository wherever you want. Then go back to Unity Hub, click the arrow directly next to the "Add" button, and hit "Add project from disk". Select the folder that contains all the files you just downloaded, click "Add project", and now you can open it in the Unity editor.
