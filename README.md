# Baldi's Extended Schoolhouse

It's Baldi's Basics, but with a twist: somehow, Baldi has raised enough money to expand the school! And of course, more space means more classroom, which means more noteboos for your friend to forget. Like usual, find all the notebooks to win!

Changes made from Baldi's Basics Classic 1.4.3:
- Two new maps to play
- Background music
- Added many changes introduced in BB+ and BBCR (new voice clips, baldicator, etc.)
- New item: Speedy Sneakers
- Changes to Baldi's AI
- more stuff im probably forgetting

Download the game [here](https://github.com/Junimeek/BaldiExtended/releases/download/beta-0.3.1/BaldiExtended-beta_0.3.1.zip).

If you want to download the source code, this project uses [Unity 2021.3.13f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.13). it was convenient.
