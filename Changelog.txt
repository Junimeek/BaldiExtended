### v0.4.3 ###
Gameplay Changes:
- There's now a map! It can be toggled on and off by simply pressing Tab.
- Two new items: Diet BSODA and Crystal flavored Zesty Bar! They're healthier versions of BSODA and Energy flavored Zesty Bar
- As a result of these items being added, there is now a significant change to the vending machines: They will now cost varying amounts of quarters depending on what item they give you. Diet BSODA and Crystal Zesty Bars will cost 1 quarter, and regular BSODA and Energy Bars will cost 2 quarters. Note that these changes do not apply to the Classic map, all items will continue to cost just 1 quarter on that map.
- The effects of the Zesty Bar can now be stacked
- You can now carry an infinite amount of quarters! To use a quarter, simply look at a vending machine and right click, and it will use any quarters you have collected. If your inventory is full, select the item you want to replace with whatever the vending machine will dispense, and it'll replace that item with the new item.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the player would not look at the Principal when sent to detention, or at Baldi when Arts and Crafters teleports you. This is actually a bug that has existed in the original game since version 1.4.0, I just never found a fix for it until now.

### v0.4.2 ###
Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug that made Juniper Hills completely impossible
- Fixed a bug with the Baldicator. Which actually turned out to be an even bigger bug with Baldi's wandering AI as a whole.* oops

*Important Note: It's still not completely fixed. Although it's mostly working now, it appears that getting sent to detention completely resets his priority. This includes when Baldi sees you before you get sent there, even though detention is supposed to have a lower priority. I can't think of a single reason as to why this is, but I really need to push this update out as Juniper Hills DESPERATELY needs to be fixed ASAP. If anyone with Unity knowledge stumbles across this and knows how to fix it, open an issue on the GitHub repo and let me know how to fix it.

### v0.4.1 ###
Gameplay Changes:
- New Item: The Attendance Slip! It will spawn in a random faculty room in Classic Extended and Juniper Hills. It will send Playtime, 1st Prize, or Gotta Sweep home (at least until the Principal notices. He WILL catch you, so use it wisely)!
- The Speedy Sneakers have been nerfed, as they were EXTREMELY broken before. Trying to work on keeping the game reasonably balanced
- Baldi's AI has changed slightly: he will remember more sounds that you make, so be careful where you go, he can follow you a lot easier now!
- When you open Gotta Sweep's door for the first time, he will immediately begin sweeping

Other Changes:
- New Help menu! It explains the story, items, controls, and the Baldicator.
- Background music volume has been slightly decreased

Bug Fixes:
- Fog should be fixed now

Note:
From here on out, the original Classic map is no longer going to receive any changes, as I feel that it should remain as close to the original game as possible.

### v0.4.0 ###
Gameplay Changes:
- New gameplay style options! Add multiplication/division problems to the math game, or play in Safe Mode for a stress-free experience
- The Principal will now only be able to see you when you can obviously see him. This is essentially just nerfing his x-ray vision that allows him to see you through multiple sets of yellow doors.

Other Changes:
- The game will now check for updates. In the launcher, you will be prompted to download a new update if a new version is found. The code I used for this is based on code created by Hamza Herbou, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-H37N6Mjlk
- Added settings for BGM, SFX, and Voice audio
- Added the ability to reset your data
- Added new icons that appear in the center of the screen when you can interact with something. For example, doors and picking up items will show a hand, having the quarter selected while looking at a vending machine will show a quarter, etc.
- There's two different versions of the same secret ending now: one for getting all questions wrong with safe mode turned on, and one without using safe mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Finally fixed Arts and Crafters teleporting you to the wrong place in Juniper Hills. Only took me a year to fix it lmao

### v0.3.1 ###
- New Secret Endings
- More bugfixes
- New Map: Juniper Hills
- Added the new math music that was used in BBCR
