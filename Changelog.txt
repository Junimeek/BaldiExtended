### v0.4.1 ###
Gameplay Changes:
- New Item: The Attendance Slip! It will spawn in a random faculty room in Classic Extended and Juniper Hills. It will send Playtime, 1st Prize, or Gotta Sweep home (at least until the Principal notices. He WILL catch you, so use it wisely)!
- The Speedy Sneakers have been nerfed, as they were EXTREMELY broken before. Trying to work on keeping the game reasonably balanced

### v0.4.0 ###
Gameplay Changes:
- New gameplay style options! Add multiplication/division problems to the math game, or play in Safe Mode for a stress-free experience
- The Principal will now only be able to see you when you can obviously see him. This is essentially just nerfing his x-ray vision that allows him to see you through multiple sets of yellow doors.

Other Changes:
- The game will now check for updates. In the launcher, you will be prompted to download a new update if a new version is found. The code I used for this is based on code created by Hamza Herbou, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-H37N6Mjlk
- Added settings for BGM, SFX, and Voice audio
- Added the ability to reset your data
- Added new icons that appear in the center of the screen when you can interact with something. For example, doors and picking up items will show a hand, having the quarter selected while looking at a vending machine will show a quarter, etc.
- There's two different versions of the same secret ending now: one for getting all questions wrong with safe mode turned on, and one without using safe mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Finally fixed Arts and Crafters teleporting you to the wrong place in Juniper Hills. Only took me a year to fix it lmao


### v0.3.1 ###
- New Secret Endings
- More bugfixes
- New Map: Juniper Hills
- Added the new math music that was used in BBCR
